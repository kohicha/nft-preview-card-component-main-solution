## Overview

This one was quite a challenge although it is a newbie one. I had a hard time figuring out how to do the active state of the image tint. I realized that overcomplicating will not help, so I started from scratch and figure out other ways. This was a fun challenge and I hope that you learn something from this ^^.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
